## Portfolio Site

This is just the build of the site that hosts projects, a blog, and my digital resume. Nothing too crazy on the front end and is still a work in progress. I have a lot of ideas in regards to the back end and it has evolved to me making a minature CMS.

## Mini Roadmap
- All Data Displayed Is Being Fetch From A DB
- Add Better Function Reusability
- Floating Blog Post Container
- Dynamically Placed Tag's in Tagging Container
- A very lite CMS To Manage The Experience and Blog Sections
- Mobile Ready
